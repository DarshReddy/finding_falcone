Set on the planet of Lengaburu. After the recent Falicornian war, King Shan exiled Queen Al Falcone for 15 years. However, if he finds her before the 15 years are up, she has to go into exile for another 15 years!

King Shan has learned that Al Falcone is hiding in one of six neighboring planets. The app has a UI through which King Shan can choose the planets to search, and the vehicles to use in Finding Falcone.
